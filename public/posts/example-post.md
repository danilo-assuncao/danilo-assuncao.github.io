# Example Blog Post

This is an example of how to create a new blog post. Simply create a new markdown file in the `/public/posts` directory with the following structure:

1. Start with frontmatter (the section between `---`)
2. Include required metadata:
   - title: Your post title
   - date: Publication date (YYYY-MM-DD)
   - description: A brief description of your post

## Writing Content

After the frontmatter, write your content using standard Markdown syntax:

- Use `#` for headings
- Use `*` or `-` for lists
- Use `**text**` for **bold text**
- Use `*text*` for *italic text*
- Use ``` for code blocks

```javascript
console.log('Hello, World!');
```

That's it! The blog will automatically detect and display your new post.
